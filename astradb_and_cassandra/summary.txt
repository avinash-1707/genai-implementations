Apache Cassandra is a distributed NoSQL database designed for high availability, fault tolerance, and scalability.
You define a keyspace (like a database), and tables (with column families), then read/write using CQL (Cassandra Query Language — similar to SQL).

Astra DB is a fully managed cloud database built on Apache Cassandra, provided by DataStax (the company behind Cassandra).
Think of Astra DB as to Cassandra what Firebase is to Firestore or Supabase is to PostgreSQL.

Astra DB now supports vector embeddings + metadata storage, meaning you can:

Store and search document embeddings (like Pinecone or Qdrant)

Use normal Cassandra tables for chat history or user sessions

Use REST/GraphQL APIs — easy integration
