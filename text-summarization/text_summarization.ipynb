    "People across the country, involved in government, political, and social activities, are dedicating their time to make the ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’ (Developed India Resolution Journey) successful. Therefore, as a Member of Parliament, it was my responsibility to also contribute my time to this program. So, today, I have come here just as a Member of Parliament and your ‘sevak’, ready to participate in this program, much like you.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our country, governments have come and gone, numerous schemes have been formulated, discussions have taken place, and big promises have been made. However, my experience and observations led me to believe that the most critical aspect that requires attention is ensuring that the government’s plans reach the intended beneficiaries without any hassles. If there is a ‘Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana’ (Prime Minister’s housing scheme), then those who are living in jhuggis and slums should get their houses. And he should not need to make rounds of the government offices for this purpose. The government should reach him. Since you have assigned this responsibility to me, about four crore families have got their ‘pucca’ houses. However, I have encountered cases where someone is left out of the government benefits. Therefore, I have decided to tour the country again, to listen to people’s experiences with government schemes, to understand whether they received the intended benefits, and to ensure that the programs are reaching everyone as planned without paying any bribes. We will get the real picture if we visit them again. Therefore, this ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’ is, in a way, my own examination. I want to hear from you and the people across the country whether what I envisioned and the work I have been doing aligns with reality and whether it has reached those for whom it was meant.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is crucial to check whether the work that was supposed to happen has indeed taken place. I recently met some individuals who utilized the Ayushman card to get treatment for serious illnesses. One person met with a severe accident, and after using the card, he could afford the necessary operation, and now he is recovering well. When I asked him, he said: “How could I afford this treatment? Now that there is the Ayushman card, I mustered courage and underwent an operation. Now I am perfectly fine.”  Such stories are blessings to me.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bureaucrats, who prepare good schemes, expedite the paperwork and even allocate funds, also feel satisfied that 50 or 100 people who were supposed to get the funds have got it. The funds meant for a thousand villages have been released. But their job satisfaction peaks when they hear that their work has directly impacted someone’s life positively. When they see the tangible results of their efforts, their enthusiasm multiplies. They feel satisfied. Therefore, ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’ has had a positive impact on government officers. It has made them more enthusiastic about their work, especially when they witness the tangible benefits reaching the people. Officers now feel satisfied with their work, saying, “I made a good plan, I created a file, and the intended beneficiaries received the benefits.” When they find that the money has reached a poor widow under the Jeevan Jyoti scheme and it was a great help to her during her crisis, they realise that they have done a good job. When a government officer listens to such stories, he feels very satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are very few who understand the power and impact of the ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’. When I hear people connected to bureaucratic circles talking about it, expressing their satisfaction, it resonates with me. I’ve heard stories where someone suddenly received 2 lakh rupees after the death of her husband, and a sister mentioned how the arrival of gas in her home transformed her lives. The most significant aspect is when someone says that the line between rich and poor has vanished. While the slogan ‘Garibi Hatao’ (Remove Poverty) is one thing, but the real change happens when a person says, “As soon as the gas stove came to my house, the distinction between poverty and affluence disappeared.\n",

It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth'),\n",

Recently, during my address to the agricultural \\nscientists while participating in a National Symposium on “Agri culture Cannot Wait”, I \\nsummarized the many practical suggestions given by farmers. W e have to double the \\nagricultural production with reduced land, reduced water resources and re duced \\nmanpower and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the principle  of \\n“Seed to Food” since agriculture is the backbone of the nation.

He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the pa rents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas.

However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs.

      "Speech:Here is a summary of the speech by A P J Abdul Kalam:\n",
      "\n",
      "President Kalam is addressing the nation and those living abroad, thanking them for the wonderful association he had during his five-year tenure in Rashtrapati Bhavan. He shares 10 important messages that he learned during his interactions with people from various walks of life, including politics, science, academia, arts, and more. The messages are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Accelerate development, focusing on the aspirations of the youth.\n",
      "2. Empower villages.\n",
      "3. Mobilize rural core competence for competitiveness.\n",
      "4. Ensure agricultural growth through \"Seed to Food\".\n",
      "5. Defeat problems and succeed.\n",
      "6. Overcome problems through partnership.\n",
      "7. Show courage in combating calamities.\n",
      "8. Foster connectivity for societal transformation.\n",
      "9. Defend the nation.\n",
      "10. Encourage a youth movement for a developed India by 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "He then shares a personal experience, recalling a question from a young girl named Anukriti who asked why India couldn't become a developed nation by 2020. Kalam appreciated the question and assured her that it was a thoughtful inquiry, and he himself was committed to ensuring India's development.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker appreciated the question as thoughtful, and assured that the person's dream would be taken to the highest institution in the nation, and they would work on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech highlights the importance of empowering villages and mobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness. The speaker recalls their visit to a village in Nagaland where they met with tribal village council members and discussed the village's progress and dreams. They saw a prosperous village with empowered village council members making decisions and taking control of their development. The speaker believes that if all 600,000 villages in India are empowered to deal with their development and are well-connected with urban societies, a significant transformation can take place.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech also mentions the Periyar PURA initiative, which aims to provide urban amenities in rural areas. This includes provision of physical, electronic, and knowledge connectivities, leading to economic connectivity. The initiative has resulted in large-scale employment generation and creation of entrepreneurs with active support. The speaker emphasizes the importance of empowering the youth to live in a prosperous, safe, and proud India and highlights the aspirations of the young to achieve this goal before 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses the success of the Periyar PURA (Providing Urban Amenities to Rural Areas) project in Thanjavur district, which has generated employment and created entrepreneurs through the active support of 1000 self-help groups. The project has transformed 200 acres of waste land into cultivable land, where villagers are now engaged in various activities such as cultivation, planting, and processing of products like Jatropha, herbal and medicinal plants, and bio-mass power generation. The project has also enabled the villagers to develop internationally competitive prototypes for 55 lifestyle products with the support of Japanese experts. The speaker emphasizes the need for similar projects to be established across the country to bridge the rural-urban divide, with a target of setting up 7000 PURA projects nationwide.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker shares two enriching experiences. Firstly, they describe a visit to Rashtrapati Bhavan, where they met over 6,000 farmers from across India. The farmers showed great interest in various gardens and interacted with horticultural specialists. The speaker emphasizes the importance of increasing agricultural production, improving economic conditions, and empowering farmers to protect the land. They believe that a partnership between farmers, scientists, and industries can achieve an agricultural GDP growth of at least 4% per annum.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, the speaker recounts a personal experience at a meeting in Coimbatore, where they met a disabled individual named Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, who had no hands or legs. Despite his physical limitations, he was radiant and confident. He thanked God, his parents, and teachers for giving him the confidence and training to overcome his challenges. When asked what the speaker could do for him, he replied that he would like to sing in front of them. The speaker concludes that this encounter has given them the confidence that anyone can overcome their problems and succeed with the right mindset.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses two separate events:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The speaker shares a personal encounter with a physically challenged individual who has a hidden talent for music. Despite his physical limitations, he has developed a positive attitude and perseverance, which has allowed him to hone his musical skills. The individual wants to use his talent to inspire others, and has even performed at a prestigious event, the Rashtra Pati Bhavan art theatre.\n",
      "2. The speaker recounts a visit to Urusa village in Jammu & Kashmir, which was affected by a devastating earthquake in 2005. Despite the severe damage to the school building, the villagers were resilient and had developed a positive attitude towards overcoming their problems. The speaker praises the courage of the people of Urusa and notes that they have become the \"masters of their problems\" rather than allowing the problems to control them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech is about the speaker's experiences with courage and resilience in the face of natural disasters and calamities. The speaker shares two specific instances:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. During a visit to a village affected by an earthquake, the speaker witnessed the bravery of children and villagers who were participating in relief operations with the Armed Forces. The speaker also saw the Acting Chief Justice of Jammu & Kashmir and state government authorities providing on-the-spot relief grants to victims whose houses were damaged.\n",
      "2. In 2005, the speaker visited the Car Nicobar Islands after the 2004 tsunami and met with the Tribal Council Leaders, students, and children. Despite the severe losses, the islanders had taken in affected victims as their own, displaying a unique trait of courage. The speaker was moved by this and composed a poem called \"Sea Waves\" with the islanders, which they sang together with enthusiasm.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech also mentions the speaker's address to the Pan African Parliament in 2004, but it is not clear what specific points were made in that address. Overall, the speech highlights the power of human courage and resilience in the face of adversity, and the importance of connectivity for societal transformation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker proposed the concept of a Pan African e-Network, connecting 53 African countries with a network of satellite, fiber optics, and wireless connections at an estimated cost of $100 million. The network aims to connect 12 universities, 17 hospitals, 53 telemedicine centers, and 53 tele-education centers across Africa. A pilot project on tele-education and tele-medicine has already been launched in Ethiopia, with Indian specialists providing medical services and Ethiopian students taking an MBA course through the Indira Gandhi National Open University.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech appears to be by the Prime Minister of India, likely Dr. Manmohan Singh, and it covers several topics. Here's a summary:\n",
      "\n",
      "* The Prime Minister highlights India's contribution to Africa, specifically mentioning the tele-consultation services provided to doctors in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, using the Pan-African network.\n",
      "* He expresses pride in India's Defence Forces, citing his personal experiences visiting the Siachen Glacier, INS Sindhurakshak, and flying in a Sukhoi-30 fighter. He praises the bravery and dedication of soldiers, sailors, and air warriors who perform their duties beyond the call of duty.\n",
      "* He also acknowledges the contributions of para-military forces, central and state police personnel, and internal security forces in maintaining the safety and security of citizens.\n",
      "* Finally, the Prime Minister mentions his interaction with a group of citizens in Hyderabad who are working towards transforming youth into enlightened citizens, as part of the Lead India 2020 Foundation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker is talking about the importance of transforming India's youth into enlightened citizens. They mention the Lead India 2020 Foundation, which is training thousands of students in Andhra Pradesh, particularly in the Medak district, in partnership with the District Administration. The speaker highlights the positive impact of the training on the students, including increased self-discipline, love for their parents and teachers, and recognition of their duties towards the nation. They also share a personal story of a student leader who was inspired by the training to help her father quit smoking. The speaker concludes that with the 540 million youth below the age of 25, India has a powerful resource that can be empowered through value-based education and leadership.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech emphasizes the importance of preserving India's rich cultural heritage and civilization for future generations. The speaker highlights the country's progress over the last 60 years and its potential to become a developed nation by 2020. They urge the audience to strive to empower individuals who are willing to contribute to the nation's growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker also outlines five distinct features of a developed India, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Reduced rural-urban divide\n",
      "2. Equitable access to energy and quality water\n",
      "3. Harmony between agriculture, industry, and service sectors\n",
      "4. Education with value system available to all meritorious candidates, regardless of societal or economic discrimination\n",
      "5. India as a top destination for talented scholars, scientists, and investors\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech concludes with a quote from a famous poem, emphasizing the importance of aiming high and working towards one's goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech outlines a vision for an ideal nation, where:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Healthcare is available to all\n",
      "* Governance is responsive, transparent, and corruption-free\n",
      "* Poverty, illiteracy, and crimes against women and children are eradicated\n",
      "* The society is prosperous, healthy, secure, peaceful, and happy, with sustained growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "President Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam expresses gratitude to the citizens for their love and support over the past five years. He mentions his mission to bring people together, fostering a sense of unity and self-confidence, believing that \"we can do it\". He concludes by stating that he will always be committed to making India a developed nation by 2020, and ends with a blessing and a call to \"Jai Hind\" (Victory to India).\n",

      "In his departure speech, former President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam reflects on his five years in office and shares 10 messages he has learned from his interactions with people from various walks of life. He emphasizes the importance of accelerating development, empowering villages, and mobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness. Kalam highlights the significance of providing physical connectivity to rural areas, such as quality roads, to facilitate the movement of products from villages to markets. He also shares a personal anecdote about a young girl's question about why India can't become a developed nation by 2020, which prompts him to assure her that her dream would be taken to the highest institution of the nation and that they would work towards making her dream a reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech also touches on the aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe, and proud India, which should be the guiding factor in whatever profession they contribute. Kalam shares his enriching experiences meeting farmers, agricultural scientists, and people with disabilities. He emphasizes the importance of \"Seed to Food\" and the need to double agricultural production with reduced resources. He also highlights the success of the Periyar PURA (Providing Urban Amenities to Rural Areas) project, which has transformed 200 acres of waste land into a cultivable area, enabling villagers to engage in sustainable economic activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, the speech showcases Kalam's inspiring encounters with individuals who have overcome challenges, such as Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, who despite having no hands and legs, radiates happiness and confidence. Kalam emphasizes the importance of empowering people with disabilities and providing them with opportunities to showcase their talents. Additionally, he shares a personal experience with a person who sang melodiously in front of him, demonstrating that even those with physical challenges can blossom with a positive attitude and perseverance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech also highlights the importance of partnership and the indomitable spirit of people, as exemplified by the residents of Urusa village in Jammu & Kashmir who recovered from a devastating earthquake in 2005. Kalam recounts his visits to villages affected by disasters, including Chuckchucha village in Car Nicobar Islands, where he witnessed the unique trait of the islanders, who took in victims of the tsunami as their own, displaying courage and resilience.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, Kalam shares his experience as the President of the Pan African Parliament in Johannesburg, South Africa, where he proposed the concept of Pan African e-Network, a seamless and integrated satellite, fiber optics, and wireless network connecting 53 African countries at an estimated cost of US $ 100 million. The project aims to connect 12 universities, 17 Super Specialty Hospitals, 53 telemedicine centers, and 53 tele-education centers in Africa, with a pilot project already commissioned in Ethiopia. This initiative aims to promote education, healthcare, and connectivity across the African continent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kalam also shares his experience of providing one-hour live tele-consultation to doctors in Black Lion Hospital, Addis Ababa in Cardiology and Radiology since November 2006, using the Pan African network. He highlights the importance of technology in bringing societal transformation in Africa and being proud of India's experience in this regard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, Kalam expresses his pride in the nation's defense forces, highlighting their bravery, commitment, and devotion to duty. He also acknowledges the contribution of para-military forces, central and state police personnel, and internal security forces in augmenting the safety and security of citizens.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, Kalam touches on the youth movement for a developed India 2020, mentioning his meeting with a group of citizens in Hyderabad who are working towards this goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, Kalam's departure speech is a reflection of his five-year tenure as President, highlighting the importance of accelerating development, empowering rural areas, promoting agricultural growth, and promoting opportunities and empowerment for all individuals, regardless of their abilities, as well as his pride in the nation's defense forces and his involvement in pan-African initiatives.\n",
